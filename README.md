# Best-Profit-for-Transportation
It's an example of use genetic algorithm for find out the most optimized routes for taxis.
# Okay , let's start 
Actually it was my course project and i've spend 2 days(if you've been a student you know that means two nights)
And after that i decided to continue with this (cause i like that i've created)
Hope I will find time to improve and continue with it.
# Height level description 
It's excelent example how to use genetic algorithm
Here is example how to use it with transportation
Here are a lot of work with google maps and as i think not bad idea how to apply genetic alg on this problem
# In Advance
Yes I know here a lot of grammar mistakes and code sometimes(like shit) but it's so bad and i am working on it
I don't sure that some normal person will read it or even push their commits :)
